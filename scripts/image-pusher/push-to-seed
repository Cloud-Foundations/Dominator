# push-to-seed sub image image_server
#
# Push an image to a sub which is running a seed image designed for importing
# an image. The seed image should implement the make-bootable service such that
# the command "service make-bootable-start" will make the parent block device
# of the destination file-system bootable.
# The following parameters are required:
#   sub:          the hostname of the sub
#   image:        the image to push
#   image_server: the hostname of the image server
